Hi, I have followed the instructions in the given tasks sheet, and in that I have downloaded the javascript file and opened the file and copied the java script.
Then I have opened the developer tools in the browser by clicking the keys **ctrl+shift+I**.Then opened the console in the developer tools and then pasted the 
java script there. Then filally it displays **IT'S DONE** in violet colour. And then starred all the AMFOSS repositories.
