Hii, actually in this task, the story is about two friend ALLEN and JOSEPH. They make word guessing game through programming. Since ALLEN is a beginner, he 
generated a lot of bugs in coding.We need to assist Alen in debugging the code so that he and Joseph can play the game and win fairly without cheating.

I have opened the terminal by clicking the shortcut key **alt+ctrl+t**. 
And I have used the command given in the task sheet.
**$ wget -O LetMeSee.c http://tiny.cc/amfoss-task5

On clicking enter, the file named **LetMeSee.c**.
