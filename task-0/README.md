Hii, finally installed ubuntu in my laptop.
First I have downloaded iso file of ubuntu version 21.04 from the official website. Then I have flashed that iso file to my 16gb pendrive using baleno etcher.
Then I have restarted my laptop and there by inserting the flashed usb drive entered the bios setup and changed the boot mode and boot options to **legacy** mode to **UEFI** mode.
I have made partitions initially in windows10 in disk management system setting. Then installed the ubuntu finally. But the problem I faced is not getting the grub menu.
For that I have used EASY BCD application for activating grub.
But I have made some error in that application and that error finally lead to missing of **/BCD ** in windows 10. This lead to the deletion of boot files in windows and not able to access windows.
My father has experience in the computer science field, and he again downloaded the iso file of windows 10 and got my windows 10 which even contains the old data including wallpaper, accounts I had signed in and everything.
Finally got my windows back and also enabled grub menu, using boot repair options.
This process took almost 3 days to resolve this problem..
